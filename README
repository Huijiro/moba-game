# MOBA Game - Godot 4.6 C++ GDExtension

A MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena) built with Godot 4.6 and C++ GDExtension.

## Quick Start

### Development with OpenCode

This project uses OpenCode for AI-assisted development with structured GitHub Projects tracking:

```bash
cd /path/to/moba-game
opencode
```

Then ask: `"What tasks are ready from moba-game?"`

Load skills as needed:
- `/skill moba-github-workflow` - Track work, pick tasks, create PRs
- `/skill moba-component-development` - Build MOBA components
- `/skill moba-testing` - Build, test, and debug
- `/skill moba-workflow-overview` - See complete workflows
